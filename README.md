# Challenge_6

## In this Challenge I used data and interactive maps to compose a data story determing the best areas in San Francisco to invest in. There were some challenges with plotting and some syntax errors I failed to notice but for the most part the challenge went well. I hope that I reviewed the data well enough to provide an accurate story of the housing market in SF.
